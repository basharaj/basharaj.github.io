My name is Bashar Abdul Jawad and I am a programmer. That doesn't mean all I can do is write code; I have also designed systems, took architectural roles,
founded 3 failed startups (not sure if I can call them startups, maybe startup-wannabes). I also have 2 degrees in Computer Science and even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Groovy-Grails-Recipes-Experts-Source/dp/143021600X">authored a book</a>, but I'll just call myself a programmer because quite frankly
I couldn't care less about titles.

 Abdul Jawad (yes both words) is my last name, so don't ever call me Jawad. I kinda regret not officially hyphenating my last name because people (especially in the US) assume that
Abdul is my middle name and Jawad is my last name. I live in Scottsdale, Arizona where I get to enjoy 8 months of awesome weather and 4 months of miserable one.

This is my personal blog about things that I find interesting enough to write about. It is mostly related to programming and technology but sometime I might write about unrelated stuff, like how
much I hate the Kardashians (which I haven't written yet, but been itching to write about).

This blog is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. Awesome blogging platform by the way.
