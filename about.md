My name is Bashar Abdul Jawad and I am a software developer. I live in Scottsdale, Arizona where I get to enjoy 8 months of awesome weather and 4 months of miserable one.
This is my personal blog about things that I find interesting enough to write about. It is mostly related to programming and technology but sometime I might write about unrelated stuff, like how
much I hate the Kardashians (which I haven't written yet, but been itching to write about).

This blog is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and is hosted on GitHub Pages.
