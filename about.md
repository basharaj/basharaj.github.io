My name is Bashar Abdul Jawad and I am a software developer. I live in Scottsdale, Arizona where I get to enjoy 8 months of awesome weather and 4 months of miserable one.
This is my personal blog about things that I find interesting enough to blog about. It is mostly related to programming and technology but sometime I might write about unrelated stuff, like how
much I hate the Kardashians.
